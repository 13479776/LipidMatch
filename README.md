# LipidMatch

LipidMatch identifications are obtained by matching experimental fragment m/z values with simulated library m/z values using in-silico fragmentation libraries of over 250,000 lipid species. LipidMatch has been tested and validated using Q-Exactive orbitrap data obtained from multiple sample types using targeted, data-dependent top-N (ddMS2-topN), and all ion fragmentation (AIF) approaches with UHPLC-HRMS/MS experiments. For AIF data, LipidMatch uses correlation coefficients to reconstruct precursor-fragment relationships. LipidMatch has also been applied for the annotation of direct infusion and imaging experiments using Q-Exactive data. The software is vendor neutral and has been tested on Agilent data-dependent (auto-MS/MS) files. The software does not currently support Waters files. LipidMatch also allows for facile integration of user generated libraries for unique applications.
